Reddit API client id and secret
----------------------------------

If you want to build Quickddit with OAuth support, remember to [get your own Reddit API client
id and secret](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2) and fill it up in
[src/quickdditmanager.cpp](src/quickdditmanager.cpp) or define `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`,
`REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` and `REDDIT_REDIRECT_URL` in project file or QtCreator.

Optionally you can also define `IMGUR_CLIENT_ID` with your own Imgur API client id.
